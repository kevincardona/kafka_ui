# Kafka UI
Kafka UI was created to provide a very simple interface to manually produce messages onto a Kafka topic. It's sorta like <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a> but for Kafka. 

Currently it is just a webapp, however I plan on converting it to an <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> app soon enough.

## Dependencies
In order to setup and run Kafka UI you must have a node package manager installed as well as node.

## Running
To install dependencies `npm install`<br>
To run Kafka UI `npm start`<br>
